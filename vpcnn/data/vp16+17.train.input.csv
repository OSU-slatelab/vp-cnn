okay, anything else
great. so today we'll have about 15 minutes to go over your back pain and your need to urinate more frequently
can you tell me more about your back pain
i see. how long ago did this occurr
where on your back is the pain
how would you describe the pain
does it radiate out at all
okay, can you tell me whether or not anything makes the pain worse or better

it must be difficult to work with back pain.

have you ever had back pain before
how painful is it for you
what makes it better
have you taken any other medications
are there any other symptoms associated with your back pain
okay, so here's what i've got so far: you are experiencing a lot of dull pain in your lower back when you try to do physical activity.
what can you tell me about your urination
is there anything else you'd like to talk about today
tell me more
hello mr. wilkins
it's nice to see you. how are you doing
i'm sorry to hear that. about how long has this been bothering you
have you ever had pain like this before
i see. a week is quite a long time to have to have this kind of pain. has it been worsening since it started
did you notice anything different in your habits before this pain started? say like halping someone move or trying a new exercise
what work do you do
that sounds very strenuous. have you been able to get any rest since the pain started
have you tried doing anything to remedy the pain in the meantime
how would you describe this pain? where abouts is it and how does it feel to you
does it seem more aching, burning, stabbing, or anything like that
is the pain worse after a day of work or upon getting up after sleeping
have you been able to rest since you have not been working
i can see how that would be frustrating for you. you mentioned never having pain like this before. what, if any, medical history do you have
have you ever presented to the doctor before for any other problems
do you have any other symptoms you would like to talk about
let's talk about your past medical history.
i see. that's very fortunate. does your family have any back pain history, or any other medical history you can think of
are you currently a smoker
that's very good for you. besides the ibuprofen you tried do you take any other medications
do you use recreational drugs
alright, thank you. let me repeat what i've heard back to you to make sure we are on the same page.
that is a very generous attitude to have, and i hope we can get you feeling better soon.
so this back pain has been mostly constant dull aching for about a week, and has been keeping you from work, correct
okay. ibuprofen has not helped, and you now feel like someone is stepping on you or squeezing hard, which hasn't changed when you have tried small tasks.
i see. we will absolutely work on a plan that fits what you are looking for. do you have any other concerns at this time
thank you for speaking with me. the doctor will be in to see you shortly.

okay.  well i hope we can help you with this.  does anything make your pain worse

how much ibuprofen have you taken

does it get better at all? after you take the ibuprofen
does it take better when you take medicine
how does it help
sure! do you notice it getting worse or better
does it get better whn you sit

okay, so you lower middle back is hurting for the last week, since you helped your buddy move.
you've taken some tylenol and it gets a littel better. but otherwise, is a dull pain

Does the back pain radiate, or is it in one spot?
Is the pain like a soreness or is it sharp?
