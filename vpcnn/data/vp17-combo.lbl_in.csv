60	Alright. Let's start with your back pain. Can you tell me more about that?
10	You're a good friend to help your buddy out! Can you describe the pain a bit more for me?
24	That must be frustrating. If you had to rate the pain on a scale from 1-10, with 1 being no pain and 10 being cutting off your leg, where would you rate it?
182	And have you tried Tylenol for this pain as well?
5	We're going to do our best to get that back pain to go away. Have you tried anything that seems to make it better?
3	Ibuprofen isn't helping... alright, is there anything that makes the pain worse?
282	That must really impede on your daily life.
158	Is the pain affecting your daily life?
63	Well we're going to do our best to get you back to work, that must be frustrating.
86	I understand. You also mentioned an increased need to urinate?
60	Can you tell me more about the frequent urination?
60	I understand. You also mentioned wanting to discuss an increased need to urinate. Can you tell me more about that?

34	And are you currently taking any medications?
35	No prescriptions?
48	Ok. Any use of drugs or alcohol?
50	Just the ibuprofen, I see. Mr. Wilkins, do you smoke?
31	I understand, I feel the same way. You said you've never had any past medical issues. Any surgeries?
87	We all have those moments. Can I ask about your family?
78	Let's talk a bit about your family. Do you have any children?
77	No children. How about siblings?
76	And an only child. Are your parents still living?
40	That's great! Have either of them had any medical issues?
40	I promise, I will do everything I can to help with your back pain. Have your parents ever had any medical issues?
75	No family history of any illnesses?
107	Alright. I think I have just about everything. Let me summarize to make sure that I got everything down correctly.
182	You came in with a dull, lower back pain that started after you helped your friend move. You also mentioned the need to urinate more frequently.
182	And that started around the same time?
182	Ok. You mentioned having tried ibuprofen, which doesn't help, but bending down tends to make it worse.
276	Could you say that again?
182	I'm not familiar with that, what is a saw palmetto?
182	The Saw Palmetto, I see. Is that something you wanted to discuss today?
16	Okay, then let's focus on your back pain. I think I have everything I need on that. I will bring this to my attending and come back, hopefully with a plan for you.
13	Hello Mr. Wilkins, how are you doing today?
8	Well that's not good! We will absolutely get to that. Is there anything else you want to discuss today?
8	We will do our best to get you feeling better. Is there anything else you want to discuss today?
60	I understand. Can you tell me more about the back pain?
2	You're a good friend! When was this?
103	How long ago did the pain begin?
10	A sharp pain just a few days ago. Can you describe the pain a bit more for me?
115	So a sharp pain that has become more dull in the middle of your lower back. Is there pain anywhere else?
24	Just your back, that's good. And can you rate the pain for me?
182	So you're taking ibuprofen that's helping a bit. Are you trying anything else that has made it better?
282	It's definitely interfering with your daily life...
158	That must be interfering with your life
3	I understand how frustrating that must be to have to stop working. Have you noticed anything that makes the pain worse?
3	No joint pain. Have you noticed anything that makes the pain worse?
3	Does anything make the pain worse?
271	Bending down and moving... You mentioned trying ibuprofen. How much do you take when you take it?
68	I understand. Do you know what dose Ibuprofen you take?
67	200 mg of ibuprofen. And how frequently are you taking that?
30	Alright. Have you ever had any back pain in the past?
182	Is this pain different from that?
31	No back surgeries?
39	We all have those moments. Do you have any other medical problems?
34	Ok. And are you taking any medications?
35	No prescriptions?
169	And are you using any other methods of treatment?
48	Okay. Mr. Wilkins, do you use drugs or alcohol?
50	Alright, and do you smoke?
87	I feel the same way. Can you tell me about your family?
78	No siblings, any children?
231	How about children?
76	Alright. Let's talk about your parents. Are they both still living?
40	That's great! Do they have any medical issues?
40	I'm going to do my best to help with your back pain. Your parent are healthy, no history of family illness/
75	And no known illness runs in the family?
98	Alright. How about your grandparents?
208	Do you know what they passed away from?
40	No known illnesses?
107	Alright. Well, I think that's everything I need. Let me summarize to make sure. 
107	You have a dull lower back pain that started a few days ago after helping your friend move.
107	The pain is only in your back, it isn't radiating elsewhere, and you'd rate it as a 7, but it is probably a 5-6 with ibuprofen
107	Even better. The ibuprofen helps a bit, but moving and bending down makes it worse.
54	And that is interfering with your job. So I'm going to take this to my attending to come up with a plan for you.
85	I'll be right back.
72	Thank you, Mr. Wilkins. I'll be right back.
